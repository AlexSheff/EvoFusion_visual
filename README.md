# EvoFusion: UI Simulation

**A web-based research framework UI for the co-evolution of neural network activation and loss functions.**

This project provides an interactive user interface to simulate and visualize a genetic algorithm that co-evolves activation and loss functions for neural networks. It leverages the Google Gemini API to dynamically generate novel symbolic functions and provide insightful analysis of the simulation results.

## Key Features

-   **Interactive Simulation:** Configure and run a simulated evolutionary process directly in your browser.
-   **Dynamic Visualization:** Watch the performance of the function population evolve in real-time with charts tracking accuracy, F1 score, and convergence speed.
-   **AI-Powered Function Generation:** Utilizes the Google Gemini API to generate an endless supply of novel, mathematically plausible activation and loss functions.
-   **AI-Generated Reports:** At the end of a run, the Gemini API analyzes the results and provides a concise, insightful summary of the evolutionary process and the best-performing function pair.
-   **Modern UI/UX:** Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a responsive, clean, and intuitive user experience.
-   **No Backend Required:** The entire simulation and visualization runs on the client-side, making it easy to run and explore.

## How It Works

1.  **Configuration:** The user sets the parameters for the simulation, including the dataset, neural network model, population size, and number of generations.
2.  **Initialization:** The simulation begins by calling the Gemini API to generate an initial population of random activation/loss function pairs.
3.  **Evolution Loop:** For each generation, the application simulates a training and evaluation process:
    -   **Fitness Evaluation:** Function pairs are assigned simulated performance scores (accuracy, F1, etc.).
    -   **Selection:** The best-performing pairs ("elites") are selected to move to the next generation.
    -   **Crossover & Mutation:** New offspring are generated by calling the Gemini API again, simulating the creation of new functions inspired by the successful ones.
4.  **Visualization:** The **Evolution Dashboard** updates in real-time, charting the average performance metrics and highlighting the best function pair found so far.
5.  **Final Report:** Once the simulation completes or is stopped by the user, a final report is generated. The Gemini API provides a qualitative summary of the run's success, and the final "champion" function pair is displayed with its metrics.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
-   **Charting:** Recharts
-   **AI Engine:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)

## Running the Application

This application is designed to run in a browser-based development environment that provides a Google Gemini API key.

1.  **API Key:** Ensure the environment variable `process.env.API_KEY` is populated with a valid Google Gemini API key.
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Load the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. The application will start on the configuration screen.
3.  **Run Simulation:** Configure your desired parameters and click "Start Evolution" to begin.
